### Description
Hello all! This repository is a Data and Predictive Analysis project on Video Streaming Platform. This project aims to predict the genre of the movies or TV shows given their release year, duration (minutes/seasons), rating and streaming platform. The dataset utilized for this project was obtained from video streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and Disney Plus). Integrating the data from various streaming platforms, this project involves Data Ingestion, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Predictive Analytics. 

### Dependencies
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sqlalchemy
- SQL:  PostgresSQL (pgAdmin4)
- PowerBI

### Workflow
- The initial datasets were subjected to data ingestion, pre-processing and merged into 2 separate dataframes and exported as csv into [tv_shows.csv](https://github.com/Ilackkeya/Video-Streaming-Platform-Data-Analytics/blob/main/Data_Cleaning/tv_shows.csv)
and [movies.csv](https://github.com/Ilackkeya/Video-Streaming-Platform-Data-Analytics/blob/main/Data_Cleaning/movies.csv)
- These dataframes were subjected to further data pre-processing and structuring required for further data analysis and was exported as csv into [TV_shows_clean_final.csv](https://github.com/Ilackkeya/Video-Streaming-Platform-Data-Analytics/blob/main/TV_shows_clean_final.csv) and [Movies_clean_final.csv](https://github.com/Ilackkeya/Video-Streaming-Platform-Data-Analytics/blob/main/Movies_clean_final.csv)
- These movies and tv shows csv files were further subjected to EDA and visualizations in PowerBI to understand the data and explore answers to certain questions.

- Finally, the predictive analysis was performed for TV shows and Movies Genre Classification System. [Predictive Analytics](https://github.com/Ilackkeya/Video-Streaming-Platform-Data-Analytics/blob/main/4.Predictive_Analytics.ipynb)
